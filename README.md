Algorithms @ Pitt. Ramirez Summer 2019. Steal at your own risk.
## Assignment 1: Anagram of String
Find every possible single-word and multi-word anagram for a given input string using backtracking and pruning.
## Assignment 2: Hybrid Trie
Create a trie that converts from a dlB to a Multiway when being a Multiway trie is considerd more memory efficient. Couldn't figure it out for some reason and ended up getting a **65%**. A real low of the summer term.
## Assignment 3: LZW Compression 
Created variations of the LZW compression algorithm and tested their efficiencies with various file inputs.
## Assignment 4: RSA Chat Server
A implementation of the RSA digital envelope that allows multiple users to securely chat with each other. First time I messed around with Java Networking which was really cool, also was fun to mess around with Java Swing again.
## Assignment 5: Graph Network
Created a custom Graph class that represented a Network and then provided some commands that a user could input. The commands involved Djikstra's, Prim's, Connected Components, and a recursive backtracking algorithm that would find all possible paths between two nodes that were under a specific weight threshold.

Ended up being a very, very, very intense summer. Though it wasn't easy, I'm glad I was able to power through the courses I took.
